I'm thrilled to share my SMART HOME project in Microcontroller Interfacing Using PIC18f4620.


- Hardware component:-

*PIC18f4620
*Lcd
*7_Segmant
*Motors
*DS1307
*tc47
*Decoder7447
*Full bridge driver
*transistor 
*relay
*push buttons
*LED
*IR sensor 


- Project description:-

~LCD display date and temperature PIC18f4620 one acte as a master,ds1307 and tc74 acte as slave,Application for I2C and LCD.
~7_segmant display time application for Decoder7447 and 7_Segmant.
~home entrance : 
It uses infrared rays to ensure that anyone enters the house, and if anyone enters the lamp, it will light up for a period of time(2.5s).
Application for IR sensor, timer0 ,internal interrupt, transistor and LDS 

~ROOM 1:-
The speed of the motors is controlled according to the temperature inside the room, and the lamps are turned on by pressing a button, 
or the lamp can be made to glow all the time or turn off all the time.
Application for ADC, DC motor, Full bridge driver, I2C, Tc74, LED and buttons 

~ROOM 2:-
The user is asked to enter the password. If it is correct, the lamp is lit and the user can control the speed of the motor using a variable resistance. 
After the user leaves the room, he gives an exit command and then everything in the room will be closed. If the password was wrong from the beginning,
it will not Anything in the room will be activated and the user will be told the password is incorrectÿ≤
Application for ADC, I2C, USART, Motor ,LED .
